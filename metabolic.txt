 [4.22] your friend will be sure and sort of [6.899] guide in this course [9.42] I really really want to thank [12.599] all of you for registering such a large [14.82] number [16.08] it it is really humbling for me that so [18.84] many people have decided to put their [21] confidence and trust in me [23.279] I promise that I will do my best [26.939] try to explain all the science to you [29.34] and in turn I expect that all of you [32.7] would be very sincere and genuine and [36.42] will decide to make changes in your [39.18] lifestyle based on what you are [41.28] convinced of not based on what I am [43.44] saying yeah but based on your [45.66] understanding of the science and your [47.82] desire to have better health and because [50.399] you are convinced that the teaching in [53.52] this course and accordingly making [55.62] changes in your lifestyle will benefit [57.18] you so I hope that most of you will [59.699] surely consider that option and give it [62.039] a try yeah so let us begin now this [66.36] course has a very different philosophy [68.28] you know in medical field [70.1] the conventional thing is you go to a [73.5] doctor you trust and you do whatever he [75.299] likes I mean whatever he says right uh [78.299] now this course is presenting a entirely [82.5] different alternative basically because [84.119] the other alternative is not working for [86.52] metabolic diseases I am sure by now you [89.28] have heard these word metabolic diseases [91.28] uh and you know what it is it will be [95.04] explained in the course of course [97.64] now uh to understand about this course [100.86] people are a lot of questions because it [102.6] is different so what we did was I had [105.78] one Zoom call to explain what is being [109.979] offered in this course how it is [111.299] different and why I think it should work [113.579] and [115.799] we also I also prepared one document [118.56] quite detailed document explaining [120.899] giving outline of this course uh and [124.02] both these modes you know this room call [126.36] and this uh document are available to [130.86] you I hope that uh all of you have gone [134.819] through those because once you have gone [136.379] through those I think 95 of your [138.599] questions would be answered so the [141.42] purpose of this this audio call is [143.76] actually to fill in little bit of gaps [146.819] go into some finer points and establish [149.58] a wrapper with you as I said uh we need [153.54] to know each other you know I need to [156.42] know you because this whole thing is [158.459] sort of a personalized not one solution [161.22] fish all and you need to know me because [165.739] some kind of trust is needed so we will [169.8] try to build on that but what I'm trying [172.319] to say is uh the zoom call not everybody [175.98] in attended the zoomco of course many of [178.8] you actually decided to join after the [181.319] zoom call so uh the zoom call [185.06] link will is will be given and I [189.48] actually request you to listen to that [191.879] Zoom call and also go through the [193.98] document that I have already circulated [197.58] and don't listen to this audio before [201.239] you have done those two things because [203.48] then you will have a lot of questions [205.379] which I'm not going to answer in this [207.239] audio because I am assuming that and [209.819] those answers which I have given in the [211.56] zoom call and the document you already [215.37] [Music] [216.56] accessed and you you have understood [219.12] them yeah now [222.56] now apart from your sincere effort to [225.78] make the changes about which you are [228.9] convinced I am also going to request you [231.799] to give me a constant feedback about [235.26] your needs what you understood what you [237.72] are not understood what you're like what [239.879] you don't like what you are whether you [243.06] think that these are too many details [244.44] whether you think that you need more [246.299] details you know the way of explaining [248.64] all kind of feedback is necessary see [251.22] earlier when I used to take the course [253.319] used to be used to be for smaller groups [255.9] say 20 25 people [257.78] I used to know them quite well or got to [261.54] know them during the course and there [264.12] were a lot of Clues you know from body [265.5] language and their reactions from which [267.84] I could judge how to modify uh or make [270.9] suitable changes in my delivery now here [274.62] I practically [276.18] know nobody very few people I really [278.22] know so I don't know what are your [280.74] expectations what kind of delivery what [283.38] kind of detailing level will suit you so [286.5] I would really like this constant [290.1] feedback from you the delivery mode of [292.86] course you know uh already that I will [295.86] be posting recorded audios you can go [300.72] through them since you can download them [302.52] or they will be there on the net so you [304.68] can go through them at your own pace at [307.5] your own Leisure [309.199] once probably most people would have to [312.419] go it through it twice because [314.36] especially if if you are not familiar [316.86] with those Concepts you know [318.68] and one thing of course at right at the [321.78] outset I want to request you or want you [324.479] is that these audios are not to be [326.639] listened to as an end like you know you [328.74] listen to say songs or from what some [333] kind of film while you are doing [334.5] something else [336.3] these audience you need to listen to [338.28] very very carefully with complete [340.919] attention and focus [343.68] not while you are taking a walk or [345.9] talking with somebody or watching [347.58] something [348.3] uh no that that that will not so I hope [351.84] that you will really give all all your [354.72] attention while listening to these audio [356.94] yeah as I said that [360] um [360.78] course outline you must have got a lot [363.12] of ideas [364.28] and you must have seen that we will be [367.8] going into many many topics the topics I [370.919] will describe I will very briefly [372.36] mention them also here like we will have [375.9] um first three or four tops on a General [379.259] Health you know what is health why our [381.479] health is so poor why we need to do [383.4] something about it and then how the [385.5] medical scenario I change why is it that [388.8] you cannot Outsource this responsibility [391.56] of having good health to Medical period [394.319] and why you need to know and why you [396.539] need to take [398.06] action now uh [401.46] this is one thing I want to uh warn you [404.88] or give you early this thing that you [407.52] will need to be very very patient what [409.979] happens is you know people come to know [411.84] about some details about the course and [414.84] then they sort of start thinking that oh [418.02] well these are a lot of new things which [419.639] I didn't know and why was I not taught I [422.22] mean the very first question that [423.479] everybody asked me especially when they [426.18] realize the importance of insulin in [429.419] this whole metabolic diseases is how [431.94] come somebody ever told me to do this [433.86] test if it is so important yeah I have I [436.68] have really no answer right why doctors [438.72] did not tell you to do this this I [442.02] cannot answer you need to ask them but [444.539] uh [448.139] what else I should do why these are my [451.08] reading what can I do what that make [453.479] changes I should make the first thing [455.4] everybody expects me okay now tell me [457.259] what to do and we will start doing it I [459.96] have tried to emphasize it again and [461.52] again no it is not that way that it [464.16] works I cannot give you a step on step [468.12] two step three do this don't do this eat [470.58] this don't eat this it doesn't work [474] I have tried to explain it number of [476.16] times that what you do what changes you [478.86] make is completely personalized and [481.02] naturally since it is personalized I [483.78] cannot help so many people to [486.24] individually tell them what they should [487.8] do and that is why they need to [489.96] understand so that they you are capable [492.479] of deciding what changes you want to [495.599] make so that is the reason why we have [498.12] to go into lot of background details you [500.639] know you need to be fully convinced that [503.699] why you cannot Outsource this by you to [506.819] understand and that is my first uh [509.16] almost two weeks uh over six seven eight [512.279] lectures we will spend on this [514.8] um background material data uh about [518.159] General Health and house scenario [520.86] exchange Etc and after this seven eight [523.979] nine lectures actually it will be [525.44] lecture number 11 when we will start [528.66] talking about diabetes so you need to be [532.38] patient go through these two three weeks [535.5] understand all the background material [537.18] and trust me believe me this is [539.82] necessary don't please please don't try [542.22] to skip them and directly go to uh [546] lecture 11 when when we start talking [548.459] about diabetes [549.86] you will not be in a position to really [553.8] use this information unless you listen [556.019] to all the audios that will be uh posted [559.98] yeah [561.48] now of course we will meet there will be [563.519] three four main topics like diabetes [565.62] nutrition obesity and cardiovascular [567.959] disease this will be the [569.7] main focus and then of course I have [573] listed number of other health related [575.399] topics let us not talk about them now [578.459] because [579.92] covering these four topics will take a [583.68] halt and sort of revisit and review what [586.56] is uh being done and what can be done [589.14] and it will take six months so this is a [591.42] very very long course uh [594.18] and at that time we will decide whether [596.12] we should go ahead and study all the [598.62] other offerings that I am willing to [600.3] make I feel very important but it is up [602.58] to you so let us not talk about them [604.38] right now so basically we'll be talking [606.899] about diabetes nutrition obesity and [609.24] lipid profile and CV CBD yeah in [612.779] diabetes as you must have sort of got [614.76] glimpse of it the whole thing will be in [616.86] Serene resistance base so we will we [619.019] will redefine diabetes [621.8] not based on the symptom of glucose [624.92] level but based on the root cause which [628.56] is that the glucose is not able to enter [631.32] the cells that is the problem so we will [634.56] Define it in terms of that then we will [636.36] see the reasons which is incident [638.459] resistance we will deeply understand [640.1] what is this incident resistance why why [643.92] you get it what to do can it be reversed [646.56] if yes then how to reverse it and then [649.26] we will talk about lot of tests uh and [652.56] then you will realize that the test that [654.12] you have been doing for so many years [655.5] are practically useless the test uh you [658.92] know I mean not that they don't give any [662.16] information they don't give sufficient [663.779] information especially if you are on the [666.36] borderline so we will talk about what [668.459] test we should do and then I will urge [670.86] you at that stage that everybody do all [674.519] those tests because that will Define [676.2] your starting point you know what is [678.06] your status of your metabolic help to [680.82] begin with and then of course you will [683.04] have your own goals and depending on the [685.2] starting point and your goals and your [687.66] willingness to the extent to which you [690.12] are prepared to make lifestyle changes [692.16] you will get reason [693.66] then we will talk about nutrition [697.44] you know a lot of misconceptions lot of [700.26] misconception starting from uh what is [703.62] carb you know so [705.18] where I tell people to avoid carbs then [708.12] after some time they are not getting [709.32] much results so I talk with them so no [712.079] no we are not eating this this we're not [714.899] taking rice we are not creating lot of [716.76] Dal so wait I said wait wait wait wait [718.56] wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait [719.279] wait wait Dal Dal why are you eating [722.519] that you want to cut down uh carbs how [725.459] can we eat that but then everybody says [727.74] oh but that is a protein no sir Dal is [730.74] not a protein Dal is 85 carbs and 15 [734.459] protein so it is a carb with lot of [737.519] protein but since it is 85 carbs you [740.579] have to sort of classified as a carb and [744.12] depending on your starting point you [745.68] know depending on your insulin level [747.26] then it will we will decide whether you [750.42] can eat Dal for some time or or not you [754.2] know so the kind of awareness of people [757.8] regarding what is sugar what is the [760.14] difference between glucose fructose and [762.3] and table sugar not many people know [765] that the table sugar is 50 fructose and [768.06] fifty percent glucose and what road does [771.899] fructose play any role so there is a lot [773.88] of ignorance about it [775.5] then there is a huge huge misconception [779.639] about fat it has been demonized and [783] large part of our talk about nutrition [785.399] will be focused on removing all these uh [788.88] fear about fats and of course especially [792.24] about saturated fats so we'll do that [794.279] about nutrition obesity again we will [797.1] see the connection between the insulin [799.2] resistance and obesity We Will We Will [802.32] describe what are the different ways ah [805.5] to solve the problem of publicity and [808.7] I will try to I will try to explain why [811.62] my way is the best way that is the way [813.66] which not only works but not only that [815.88] you are able to reduce the weight but [817.32] you are able to maintain the weight then [819.42] we'll go to repeat profile again [821.639] huge ignorance about lipid profile you [824.639] have been bombarded and you have been [826.92] told that LDL LDL LDL LDL you must focus [830.339] on LDL take Statin foreign [832.82] against reducing LDL and nothing against [835.44] 13 but uh [838.32] you will realize that first of all you [841.26] will understand what are these different [842.579] lipid particles you know even educated [845.639] people they they think even they talk [847.92] about cholesterol they think about uh [850.38] immediately about good cholesterol and [852.06] bad cholesterol sir there is there is [855.48] nothing like cholesterol and bad [857.22] cholesterol cholesterol is cholesterol [858.779] it is a simple molecule it is a unique [861.54] molecule there are no two molecules you [863.7] know now there are two varieties not [865.74] even isomers those who know about isomer [867.959] you know no two varieties of cholesterol [870.48] and one variety is good and one variety [872.279] is bad nothing like that cholesterol is [875.76] good it is absolutely not useful it is [878.7] essential now you remove cholesterol [880.74] from our body you will be dead in five [882.42] minutes yeah is absolutely essential [885.18] component of so many things now this [888.42] whether the cholesterol ah proves to be [891.36] you harmful to you or beneficial to you [894.36] depends on the type of vehicle in which [897.3] it is carried and will go deep in that [899.279] you'll understand the difference between [901.139] LDL and HDL is not in terms of [903.12] cholesterol but in terms of the proteins [906] that are lying on the vehicle which is [908.399] carrying these lipid particles so we [910.8] will do all that we will also [912.8] understand that if at all you have to [915.54] sort of rank all these particles you [918.06] know in terms of their importance in the [920.82] risk profile to CBD you will see that at [923.1] least for mostly by Asians ah is the [925.92] triglyceride level which is important [927.86] and one of the biggest surprise that [931.199] people in negate in this course is yeah [934.5] you must have heard that lipid I mean [937.079] triglycer is bad and and therefore what [940.139] you should do you you go to the height [941.94] well triglycerative doctor he will tell [944.82] you stop [946.62] pad and in this course what you'll be [950.22] told no you increase the fat as much as [952.98] possible and this is so counterintuitive [956.519] this is you know very difficult to [958.019] believe but then that is a Eureka moment [960.779] when you see the equations when you see [962.519] the uh how uh the fact that it is [966.899] processed completely differently through [969.54] a chiro Micron root rather than a vlds [973.26] road you will realize that yeah if I eat [976.26] more fat my [979.88] side table goes down goes around very [982.32] sharply and goes down quite quickly and [985.079] so a lot of new information will be [987.779] there in CBD also we will Define [989.399] differently so this is just about what [992.459] we will cover and there will be lot of [994.44] lectures on each of these topics so I [996.42] did not I cannot I should not go into a [1000.199] lot of details [1003.22] in the actual course but this is just to [1006.44] give you an overall idea about what we [1008.72] will do in the course now we will go to [1011.12] a bigger issue okay you have understood [1013.399] what will be taught in this course and [1017.62] the board in which will be done and [1019.94] probably by this time uh you must have [1022.699] got convinced when you listen to the [1024.799] earlier Preparatory background [1026.9] information videos that yes my doctor is [1030.799] not will not be [1033.28] able to cure me of this decision of [1037.04] course cannot be cured you can only [1038.78] reduce the risk but I think obesity and [1042.939] diabetes problem can be entirely solved [1046.88] I'll talk about that in a little bit of [1048.799] time but by this time you must you might [1051.559] have got convinced that yes uh [1054.5] normal medical treatment can probably [1056.98] keep my symptoms in check but it cannot [1059.96] remove the root cause and cannot cure me [1062.86] if you are not convinced that then [1065] actually you should not continue with [1066.38] the course because the whole point of [1068.6] this course is that only that why you [1070.82] need to take things you know right and [1072.08] why others cannot help you so if you're [1075.14] not convinced about that read the [1077.419] material again talk to me discuss with [1080.48] me I will convince you and then only you [1082.52] should actually start going through the [1085.22] videos from diabetes
