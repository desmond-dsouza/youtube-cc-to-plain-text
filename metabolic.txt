 your friend will be sure and sort of guide in this course I really really want to thank all of you for registering such a large number it it is really humbling for me that so many people have decided to put their confidence and trust in me I promise that I will do my best try to explain all the science to you and in turn I expect that all of you would be very sincere and genuine and will decide to make changes in your lifestyle based on what you are convinced of not based on what I am saying yeah but based on your understanding of the science and your desire to have better health and because you are convinced that the teaching in this course and accordingly making changes in your lifestyle will benefit you so I hope that most of you will surely consider that option and give it a try yeah so let us begin now this course has a very different philosophy you know in medical field the conventional thing is you go to a doctor you trust and you do whatever he likes I mean whatever he says right uh now this course is presenting a entirely different alternative basically because the other alternative is not working for metabolic diseases I am sure by now you have heard these word metabolic diseases uh and you know what it is it will be explained in the course of course now uh to understand about this course people are a lot of questions because it is different so what we did was I had one Zoom call to explain what is being offered in this course how it is different and why I think it should work and we also I also prepared one document quite detailed document explaining giving outline of this course uh and both these modes you know this room call and this uh document are available to you I hope that uh all of you have gone through those because once you have gone through those I think 95 of your questions would be answered so the purpose of this this audio call is actually to fill in little bit of gaps go into some finer points and establish a wrapper with you as I said uh we need to know each other you know I need to know you because this whole thing is sort of a personalized not one solution fish all and you need to know me because some kind of trust is needed so we will try to build on that but what I'm trying to say is uh the zoom call not everybody in attended the zoomco of course many of you actually decided to join after the zoom call so uh the zoom call link will is will be given and I actually request you to listen to that Zoom call and also go through the document that I have already circulated and don't listen to this audio before you have done those two things because then you will have a lot of questions which I'm not going to answer in this audio because I am assuming that and those answers which I have given in the zoom call and the document you already [Music] accessed and you you have understood them yeah now now apart from your sincere effort to make the changes about which you are convinced I am also going to request you to give me a constant feedback about your needs what you understood what you are not understood what you're like what you don't like what you are whether you think that these are too many details whether you think that you need more details you know the way of explaining all kind of feedback is necessary see earlier when I used to take the course used to be used to be for smaller groups say 20 25 people I used to know them quite well or got to know them during the course and there were a lot of Clues you know from body language and their reactions from which I could judge how to modify uh or make suitable changes in my delivery now here I practically know nobody very few people I really know so I don't know what are your expectations what kind of delivery what kind of detailing level will suit you so I would really like this constant feedback from you the delivery mode of course you know uh already that I will be posting recorded audios you can go through them since you can download them or they will be there on the net so you can go through them at your own pace at your own Leisure once probably most people would have to go it through it twice because especially if if you are not familiar with those Concepts you know and one thing of course at right at the outset I want to request you or want you is that these audios are not to be listened to as an end like you know you listen to say songs or from what some kind of film while you are doing something else these audience you need to listen to very very carefully with complete attention and focus not while you are taking a walk or talking with somebody or watching something uh no that that that will not so I hope that you will really give all all your attention while listening to these audio yeah as I said that um course outline you must have got a lot of ideas and you must have seen that we will be going into many many topics the topics I will describe I will very briefly mention them also here like we will have um first three or four tops on a General Health you know what is health why our health is so poor why we need to do something about it and then how the medical scenario I change why is it that you cannot Outsource this responsibility of having good health to Medical period and why you need to know and why you need to take action now uh this is one thing I want to uh warn you or give you early this thing that you will need to be very very patient what happens is you know people come to know about some details about the course and then they sort of start thinking that oh well these are a lot of new things which I didn't know and why was I not taught I mean the very first question that everybody asked me especially when they realize the importance of insulin in this whole metabolic diseases is how come somebody ever told me to do this test if it is so important yeah I have I have really no answer right why doctors did not tell you to do this this I cannot answer you need to ask them but uh what else I should do why these are my reading what can I do what that make changes I should make the first thing everybody expects me okay now tell me what to do and we will start doing it I have tried to emphasize it again and again no it is not that way that it works I cannot give you a step on step two step three do this don't do this eat this don't eat this it doesn't work I have tried to explain it number of times that what you do what changes you make is completely personalized and naturally since it is personalized I cannot help so many people to individually tell them what they should do and that is why they need to understand so that they you are capable of deciding what changes you want to make so that is the reason why we have to go into lot of background details you know you need to be fully convinced that why you cannot Outsource this by you to understand and that is my first uh almost two weeks uh over six seven eight lectures we will spend on this um background material data uh about General Health and house scenario exchange Etc and after this seven eight nine lectures actually it will be lecture number 11 when we will start talking about diabetes so you need to be patient go through these two three weeks understand all the background material and trust me believe me this is necessary don't please please don't try to skip them and directly go to uh lecture 11 when when we start talking about diabetes you will not be in a position to really use this information unless you listen to all the audios that will be uh posted yeah now of course we will meet there will be three four main topics like diabetes nutrition obesity and cardiovascular disease this will be the main focus and then of course I have listed number of other health related topics let us not talk about them now because covering these four topics will take a halt and sort of revisit and review what is uh being done and what can be done and it will take six months so this is a very very long course uh and at that time we will decide whether we should go ahead and study all the other offerings that I am willing to make I feel very important but it is up to you so let us not talk about them right now so basically we'll be talking about diabetes nutrition obesity and lipid profile and CV CBD yeah in diabetes as you must have sort of got glimpse of it the whole thing will be in Serene resistance base so we will we will redefine diabetes not based on the symptom of glucose level but based on the root cause which is that the glucose is not able to enter the cells that is the problem so we will Define it in terms of that then we will see the reasons which is incident resistance we will deeply understand what is this incident resistance why why you get it what to do can it be reversed if yes then how to reverse it and then we will talk about lot of tests uh and then you will realize that the test that you have been doing for so many years are practically useless the test uh you know I mean not that they don't give any information they don't give sufficient information especially if you are on the borderline so we will talk about what test we should do and then I will urge you at that stage that everybody do all those tests because that will Define your starting point you know what is your status of your metabolic help to begin with and then of course you will have your own goals and depending on the starting point and your goals and your willingness to the extent to which you are prepared to make lifestyle changes you will get reason then we will talk about nutrition you know a lot of misconceptions lot of misconception starting from uh what is carb you know so where I tell people to avoid carbs then after some time they are not getting much results so I talk with them so no no we are not eating this this we're not taking rice we are not creating lot of Dal so wait I said wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait Dal Dal why are you eating that you want to cut down uh carbs how can we eat that but then everybody says oh but that is a protein no sir Dal is not a protein Dal is 85 carbs and 15 protein so it is a carb with lot of protein but since it is 85 carbs you have to sort of classified as a carb and depending on your starting point you know depending on your insulin level then it will we will decide whether you can eat Dal for some time or or not you know so the kind of awareness of people regarding what is sugar what is the difference between glucose fructose and and table sugar not many people know that the table sugar is 50 fructose and fifty percent glucose and what road does fructose play any role so there is a lot of ignorance about it then there is a huge huge misconception about fat it has been demonized and large part of our talk about nutrition will be focused on removing all these uh fear about fats and of course especially about saturated fats so we'll do that about nutrition obesity again we will see the connection between the insulin resistance and obesity We Will We Will describe what are the different ways ah to solve the problem of publicity and I will try to I will try to explain why my way is the best way that is the way which not only works but not only that you are able to reduce the weight but you are able to maintain the weight then we'll go to repeat profile again huge ignorance about lipid profile you have been bombarded and you have been told that LDL LDL LDL LDL you must focus on LDL take Statin foreign against reducing LDL and nothing against 13 but uh you will realize that first of all you will understand what are these different lipid particles you know even educated people they they think even they talk about cholesterol they think about uh immediately about good cholesterol and bad cholesterol sir there is there is nothing like cholesterol and bad cholesterol cholesterol is cholesterol it is a simple molecule it is a unique molecule there are no two molecules you know now there are two varieties not even isomers those who know about isomer you know no two varieties of cholesterol and one variety is good and one variety is bad nothing like that cholesterol is good it is absolutely not useful it is essential now you remove cholesterol from our body you will be dead in five minutes yeah is absolutely essential component of so many things now this whether the cholesterol ah proves to be you harmful to you or beneficial to you depends on the type of vehicle in which it is carried and will go deep in that you'll understand the difference between LDL and HDL is not in terms of cholesterol but in terms of the proteins that are lying on the vehicle which is carrying these lipid particles so we will do all that we will also understand that if at all you have to sort of rank all these particles you know in terms of their importance in the risk profile to CBD you will see that at least for mostly by Asians ah is the triglyceride level which is important and one of the biggest surprise that people in negate in this course is yeah you must have heard that lipid I mean triglycer is bad and and therefore what you should do you you go to the height well triglycerative doctor he will tell you stop pad and in this course what you'll be told no you increase the fat as much as possible and this is so counterintuitive this is you know very difficult to believe but then that is a Eureka moment when you see the equations when you see the uh how uh the fact that it is processed completely differently through a chiro Micron root rather than a vlds road you will realize that yeah if I eat more fat my side table goes down goes around very sharply and goes down quite quickly and so a lot of new information will be there in CBD also we will Define differently so this is just about what we will cover and there will be lot of lectures on each of these topics so I did not I cannot I should not go into a lot of details in the actual course but this is just to give you an overall idea about what we will do in the course now we will go to a bigger issue okay you have understood what will be taught in this course and the board in which will be done and probably by this time uh you must have got convinced when you listen to the earlier Preparatory background information videos that yes my doctor is not will not be able to cure me of this decision of course cannot be cured you can only reduce the risk but I think obesity and diabetes problem can be entirely solved I'll talk about that in a little bit of time but by this time you must you might have got convinced that yes uh normal medical treatment can probably keep my symptoms in check but it cannot remove the root cause and cannot cure me if you are not convinced that then actually you should not continue with the course because the whole point of this course is that only that why you need to take things you know right and why others cannot help you so if you're not convinced about that read the material again talk to me discuss with me I will convince you and then only you should actually start going through the videos from diabetes
